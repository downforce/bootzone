Bootstrap theme for Zoneminder.

Taken the stock skin for Zoneminder and updating it to be Bootstrap'ed.

This is really for personal use but put it up here for anyone to use/share. 

So far I've done a few pages and they look pretty schmick. It even works great on my Android tablets (Nexus 7 & TF101), although requires Firefox for Android to get Cambozola working

Plan on doing this in a few stages:
1. Pure 'skinning', convert as much as possible to Bootstrap scaffolding, base CSS and components.
2. Improve the UI so it's more of a single display, rather than a new window for each page/function. Probably go with modals as much as possible.
3. The fun part, utilise Bootstrap Mootools JS tools, e.g http://anutron.github.io/mootools-bootstrap/

At the moment I'm up to step 1.

A few goals are:
* Don't hack any of the standard Zoneminder codes;
* Base it as much as possible on the stock Zoneminder theme, esp the php code. This allows for future 'upgradability';
* Make it look good;
* Make it work on mobile devices (at least Android).
